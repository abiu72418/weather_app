# weather_app

Create a simple weather dashboard in a single HTML file. It should have an input field for a city name and a 'Get Weather' button. When the button is clicked, use the Fetch API to get weather data from a free weather API and display the current temperature for that city on the page. Style it to be clean and modern.
